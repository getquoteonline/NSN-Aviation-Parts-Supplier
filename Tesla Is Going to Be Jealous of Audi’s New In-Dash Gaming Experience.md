# Tesla Is Going to Be Jealous of Audi’s New In-Dash Gaming Experience

In-car entertainment has come a long way since the days of cassette players and flip-out DVD screens. As cars become increasingly digital and connected, manufacturers are finding innovative ways to transform the passenger experience. Audi’s latest move — integrating the **AirConsole gaming platform** into select models — is a game changer that even Tesla will want to keep an eye on.

## 🎮 The Evolution of In-Car Entertainment

Anyone who’s spent time on long road trips knows how crucial good entertainment can be for passengers. In the early 2000s, the best in-car entertainment systems were usually bulky DVD players, often reserved for high-end minivans or SUVs. Fast-forward to today, and the dashboard is dominated by large, high-resolution touchscreens that serve as infotainment hubs.

Audi has taken advantage of this trend by partnering with **AirConsole**, a virtual gaming platform that allows passengers to play games right on the car’s infotainment screen — using their smartphones as controllers.

## 🚗 How Audi’s AirConsole Works

The AirConsole gaming platform is now available on the **Audi Application Store** for models equipped with Android-based infotainment systems, such as:

- Audi A5  
- Audi Q5  
- Audi A6 & A6 e-tron  
- Audi Q6 e-tron  

Passengers simply scan a QR code displayed on the infotainment screen to connect their smartphones as wireless controllers. This seamless setup enables solo or multiplayer gaming sessions on the central display — and in some models equipped with passenger screens, gaming can continue even while the car is in motion.

Audi’s **dynamic privacy mode** ensures gameplay doesn’t distract the driver by hiding the game interface from their view.

## 🕹️ An Expansive Catalog of Games

The game selection on AirConsole is broad and growing, including puzzle games, trivia, and party favorites like:

- **UNO Car Party!**  
- **Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?**  
- **Pictionary Car Party**

These games are designed to encourage interaction and engagement among passengers, providing a fun alternative to the usual passive screen time.

## 🚘 A Trend in Luxury Automakers

Audi isn’t the first luxury automaker to embrace in-car gaming. BMW was an early adopter, launching AirConsole integration first in its 7 Series before expanding to MINI models. Tesla, however, was a pioneer of in-car gaming with its **Tesla Arcade**, launched in 2019.

Tesla Arcade focuses on more graphic-intensive titles like *Cuphead*, *Sonic the Hedgehog*, and *Beach Buggy Racing 2*. It even supports external Bluetooth controllers, including those from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Some games allow the driver to use the actual steering wheel as a controller — but only when parked, for safety.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Audi’s integration of AirConsole highlights a growing trend: cars aren’t just transportation devices anymore, they are **personalized digital hubs**. This shift opens exciting possibilities for enhancing passenger enjoyment, especially during long drives or traffic jams.

Personally, I see great value in these multiplayer games that encourage communication and socializing rather than isolating passengers on their individual devices. While Tesla’s Tesla Arcade is geared more toward serious gaming enthusiasts, Audi’s approach brings accessible, casual fun to the whole car.

Whether you’re cruising in an Audi or a Tesla, the future of in-car entertainment is bright — and a lot more playful.
