# Lexus and Nissan Dominate 2025 J.D. Power Initial Quality Rankings — Audi and Volvo Struggle

The **2025 J.D. Power Initial Quality Study (IQS)** is out, and it has shaken up the auto industry’s perception of reliability. While **Lexus** and **Nissan** emerged as clear leaders, brands like **Audi**, **Volvo**, and even **Ram** saw significant drops. But behind these scores are real-world manufacturing details — from components to engineering design — that influence how vehicles perform fresh off the lot.

Let’s take a look at the surprises from this year’s IQS and how critical parts like [alternators](https://www.partsquote.org/104925-13.html) and [ball bearings](https://www.partsprohub.com/3110011917371.html) contribute to quality scores.

## 🚗 The Top Performers: Lexus and Nissan Lead the Way

**Lexus** topped the list across all categories with a **PP100 score of 166**, making it the best not just in the luxury segment, but overall. That means Lexus vehicles had fewer reported problems per 100 vehicles in the first 90 days of ownership than any other brand.

Surprisingly close behind was **Nissan**, at **169 PP100**, earning the top spot among mainstream brands. Much of Nissan’s success comes from the refinement of its core models and strong quality control standards in final assembly.

### What Helps These Brands Stand Out?

It’s not just brand strategy — high-quality internal components play a huge role:

- ✅ [**104925-13 – Alternating Current Generator**](https://www.partsquote.org/104925-13.html)  
  Found in numerous vehicles, this part is key for electrical reliability. Stable current output means fewer glitches in infotainment, power steering, and climate control.

- ✅ [**3110-01-191-7371 – Ball Bearing**](https://www.partsprohub.com/3110011917371.html)  
  Used in drivetrain and suspension systems, these ensure long-lasting, smooth performance — especially critical for Japanese automakers like Nissan.

## 🚨 The Fall From Grace: Ram, Audi, and Volvo

Last year’s winner **Ram** suffered a **24-spot fall**, now holding a **PP100 score of 218**, well below the industry average of 192. Blame it largely on the **2025 Ram 1500**, which underwent a full redesign — and with it, new production issues.

**Audi** sits at the bottom with **269 PP100**, closely followed by **Volvo** at **258 PP100**. Both saw a rise in owner-reported problems, particularly related to electronic systems and driver assistance features.

### What Could Be Going Wrong?

Advanced systems demand durable components, and any compromise can result in a poor user experience:

- ⚠️ [**5925-01-567-3790 – Circuit Breaker**](https://www.optiultra.com/5925015673790.html)  
  A failing breaker can lead to intermittent or total failure in key subsystems, triggering owner complaints.

- ⚠️ [**HM514260AJB – Bearing Roller Tapered**](https://www.partsquotehub.org/HM514260AJB.html)  
  Poor-quality or misaligned bearings in premium vehicles can cause early wear, vibration, or even wheel hub issues.

## 🤯 Surprise Climber: Jaguar Rises to 4th

A major surprise this year was **Jaguar**, climbing to **fourth place** with a score of **175 PP100** — outperforming Hyundai and most U.S. and European brands. Experts believe this is due to the automaker narrowing its product lineup and refining existing platforms.

Jaguar’s success echoes a principle well understood by manufacturers: simplifying component variability and focusing on proven parts drives better outcomes.
