# 🔥 Hyundai N Division Isn’t Done With Gasoline – ICE Still Has a Future

In an automotive landscape increasingly shifting toward electric mobility, **Hyundai's N Division** has been steering headlines with bold EV performance models like the Ioniq 5 N. But here’s a breath of fresh (combustion-fueled) air for old-school enthusiasts: **internal combustion engine (ICE)** cars aren’t leaving the N Division lineup anytime soon.

Yes, Hyundai’s N boss has confirmed it — **gas-powered cars are still part of the plan**, and fans of growling engines and tactile driving dynamics can breathe a sigh of relief.

## 🏁 A Quick Recap: N Division's Rise to Relevance

Hyundai N is a relative newcomer to performance circles, especially compared to veterans like BMW M and Mercedes-AMG. Its U.S. debut in 2019 with the feisty **Veloster N** was a wake-up call — Hyundai wasn't just dabbling in performance; it was all in.

In recent years, the focus shifted to EVs:

- The **Ioniq 5 N** showcased electric performance done right — with **up to 641 horsepower** and wild features like **N Drift Optimizer**.
- The **Elantra N**, meanwhile, held the torch for combustion, offering a snarling, affordable sedan experience for purists.

But many feared the combustion era was over for N — until now.

## 🚘 ICE Isn't Dead: What Hyundai Just Revealed

Speaking recently in London, **Joon Park**, head of Hyundai’s N division, clarified:

> “Even though we are going to introduce the Ioniq 6 N at Goodwood Festival of Speed, we are not limiting ourselves to EVs.”

That single sentence changes the narrative entirely.

**Hyundai is committed to a dual-track future** — with room for electric, hybrid, and gas-powered N models. And that opens the door to innovation across all powertrain types:

- **Hybrids** and **range extenders** may feature soon
- More ICE models may use Hyundai’s proven **2.0L turbo-four**, already beloved in the Elantra N
- Future gas-powered models could benefit from lighter chassis and improved thermal efficiency

## 🧠 N Division Tech Evolution – For All Platforms

While the **Ioniq 6 N** debut is coming soon and will likely include tech like **simulated gear shifts**, **N Active Sound+**, and **track modes**, combustion-powered N models will continue to offer the visceral experience that EVs are still learning to emulate.

But to maintain quality and reliability, it’s critical that performance components are engineered with precision. That’s where trusted, military-grade and aerospace-quality components come into play, such as:
