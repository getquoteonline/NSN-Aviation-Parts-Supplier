# Why Tesla Faces a $58K Daily Fine Over Its Marketing Practices

Tesla, the trailblazer of electric vehicles, is facing increasing scrutiny over its marketing tactics — and the latest challenge comes from France, where the automaker risks a hefty $58,000 daily fine if it doesn’t comply within four months.

## 🇫🇷 France’s Ministry of the Economy Steps In

The French Ministry of the Economy has launched a serious investigation into Tesla’s sales practices, especially around the marketing of the **Full Self-Driving (FSD)** feature. Despite its name, FSD is not fully autonomous and doesn’t operate at the much-anticipated Level 5 autonomy, which sparked consumer complaints leading to the probe.

Since 2023, France’s consumer complaint service, **SignalConso**, has been fielding reports accusing Tesla of deceptive commercial practices related to:

- Overstating the autonomous capabilities of FSD  
- Lack of clarity on car delivery dates, deadlines, and locations  
- Incomplete information about credit-based purchases  
- Customers making payments before their withdrawal period ends  
- Failure to provide receipts for partial cash payments  
- Delays or refusals in refunds within legal deadlines  

If Tesla doesn’t fix these issues in the next four months, it faces fines of $58,000 **per day** — a staggering potential penalty that underscores the seriousness of the violations.

## 🚗 What Does This Mean for Tesla Owners?

The French investigation signals a broader push for transparency and consumer protection, particularly as advanced driver assistance systems become more common.

Tesla’s FSD marketing has been controversial worldwide. The software provides advanced driver assistance but requires constant driver supervision, making the term “Full Self-Driving” misleading in many eyes.

## 🌏 Global Crackdowns on FSD Terminology

France isn’t alone in taking action:

- **China** cracked down on the use of terms like “self-driving” and “autonomous driving,” requiring companies to use phrases like “combined assisted driving.” Tesla responded by renaming FSD to **“Intelligent Assisted Driving”** in China.  
- **California** banned Tesla from using FSD terminology that implies autonomy in 2022, enforcing strict language rules to prevent consumer confusion.

These moves reflect growing regulatory pressure globally to ensure consumers are accurately informed about the capabilities of driver-assist technologies.
