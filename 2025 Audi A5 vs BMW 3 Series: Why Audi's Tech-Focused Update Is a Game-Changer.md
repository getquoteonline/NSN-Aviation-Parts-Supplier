## Technology: Audi's Digital Edge

The 2025 Audi A5 debuts a **10.9-inch passenger touchscreen display**, complete with *Active Privacy Mode* — a feature not found in BMW’s 3 Series. Using digital curtain technology and directional light projection, the A5 ensures the driver remains undistracted while the passenger enjoys entertainment.

Complementing this is a **dashboard-spanning LED strip**, providing visual feedback for system confirmations like turn signals, lock/unlock, and more — another feature missing in the 3 Series.

### Behind the Scenes: Electronic Reliability Matters

Such in-cabin tech relies on dependable electrical connectivity. That’s where components like:

## Handling and Dynamics: No More Understeer

One major criticism of past A5 models was understeer. Audi listened. The 2025 A5 boasts **refreshed suspension and steering**, delivering a more neutral, responsive feel that now rivals — and in some scenarios, outperforms — the BMW 3 Series.

Both cars have AWD options, but Audi makes **Quattro standard**, while BMW’s **xDrive** remains optional.

## Performance Meets Practicality

- **Audi A5**: 261 hp, 295 lb-ft torque, 7-speed dual-clutch auto  
- **BMW 3 Series**: 255 hp, 295 lb-ft torque, 8-speed automatic

While both match on torque, the A5 provides a slight edge in horsepower and delivers a **dual-clutch transmission** for more engaging shifts. Pair this with **26 cu. ft. of cargo space**, and Audi’s advantage extends to practicality too.
