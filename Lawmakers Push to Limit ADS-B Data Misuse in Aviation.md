# 🛰️ Lawmakers Push to Limit ADS-B Data Misuse in Aviation

**New legislation aims to protect pilots and general aviation from unfair data usage and third-party fees.**

On **June 29, 2025**, Senator **Ted Budd (R-NC)** introduced the **Pilot and Aircraft Privacy Act (S.2175)**, co-sponsored by Senators **Dan Sullivan (R-AK)** and **Tim Sheehy (R-MT)**, with **Rep. Robert F. Onder (R-MO)** leading the House companion bill, **H.4146**. The act seeks to address growing concerns about how **ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast)** data is being misused beyond its intended purpose of aviation safety.

## 🔍 What the Bill Proposes

The legislation would:

- **Prohibit** the use of ADS-B data by government or private entities to impose **airport fees or charges**.
- **Clarify** that ADS-B can only be used by **air traffic controllers** for traffic safety and efficiency, or for other reasons approved by the **Secretary of Transportation** after public input.
- **Prevent** the use of ADS-B data as the basis for launching investigations.
- **Mandate transparency** from public-use airports, requiring disclosure of **financial impact** and intended safety improvements before imposing new fees on general aviation.

> _"Some third parties have taken advantage of ADS-B data to collect exorbitant fees and file frivolous lawsuits,"_ said Rep. Onder. _"These misuses are deterring pilots from installing life-saving technology."_

## ✈️ Understanding ADS-B and Its Role in Aviation Safety

**ADS-B Out**, a system that broadcasts an aircraft’s location, speed, and altitude, has been **mandatory since 2020** for aircraft operating in controlled airspace, following an FAA rule finalized in 2010.

While **ADS-B enhances safety** by improving situational awareness, its real-time nature also opens it to **potential abuse**—a concern echoed by many general aviation pilots and advocacy groups.
