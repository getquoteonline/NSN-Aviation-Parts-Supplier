# Thousands of Chevrolet Pickups Could Catch Fire Over Unsafe Chemicals


Chevrolet Silverado Medium Duty pickups—specifically the 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD models from 2019 to 2024—are facing a serious safety concern. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently issued a recall affecting over **62,000** of these vehicles due to a **brake system defect** that could potentially lead to fires.

---

## What’s Behind the Recall?

The issue centers on the **brake pressure sensor assemblies**. According to the NHTSA, a faulty component inside these assemblies may cause **brake fluid leaks**, which in turn can lead to short circuits and, in rare cases, vehicle fires. 

The root cause was traced back to an **unauthorized chemical used in the brake assembly manufacturing process**. This problem first emerged during a previous recall in April 2023, which targeted a **fragmenting zinc sealant** interfering with diaphragm integrity. Despite the earlier recall, further issues persisted, and after multiple investigations and tests conducted through early 2025, GM officially initiated this new recall to address the risk.
