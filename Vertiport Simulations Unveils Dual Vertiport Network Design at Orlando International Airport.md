# Vertiport Simulations Unveils Dual Vertiport Network Design at Orlando International Airport  

---

In a major leap for **Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)**, U.S.-based **Vertiport Simulations (VS)** has completed its ambitious vision for a **Dual Vertiport Network at Orlando International Airport (OIA)**. The innovative concept, revealed this week, includes two distinct vertiport facilities and is already operational in **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024**, offering simulated takeoffs and landings using **Archer’s Midnight** and **Joby’s S-4 eVTOL** aircraft.

## Primary Vertiport Features at OIA

The main vertiport will showcase an expansive infrastructure designed to handle the needs of modern eVTOL operations:

- **eSTOL runway** (Electric Short Takeoff and Landing)  
- **8 Final Approach and Takeoff Areas (FATO)**  
- **4 Skyportz Vertipads**  
- **2 Cherokee Federal MVP towable vertipads**  
- **Hangar space for over 50 eVTOLs**  
- A large **solar panel array** capable of powering both the facility and its aircraft autonomously

The power generation system is based on a **modular platform by Electro Aero**, designed to **streamline permitting and setup**, eliminating dependency on traditional grid power.

## Secondary Vertiport Location

Located next to the Brightline train station on OIA property, this smaller vertiport will include:

- **2 Skyportz Vertipads**  
- A **passenger terminal**  
- **Covered vehicle parking**

This site aims to demonstrate flexibility in vertiport placement across urban hubs and transit corridors.

## Strategic Impact and Industry Adoption

Recently, Orlando International Airport shortlisted **Atlantic Aviation** and **Signature Aviation/UrbanV Orlando** as potential partners to realize this infrastructure. **Joe Mattern, CEO of Vertiport Simulations**, is optimistic the digital models will influence final selections:

> “We’ve built our ultimate vision of a dual vertiport network, and hope to inspire stakeholders at Atlantic and Signature Aviation,” said Mattern. “In the coming months, we’ll expand our vision by deploying vertiport models across 23 more Florida cities.”

These digital simulations help cities and agencies visualize **vertiport placement, urban air traffic, and integration challenges**, supporting regulatory planning and public engagement.
