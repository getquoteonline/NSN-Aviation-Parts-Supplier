## ✈️ Fast-Track to the Towers: How AT-CTI Works

The **Enhanced AT-CTI** program allows qualified graduates to **bypass the FAA Academy’s introductory course** and report directly to ATC facilities—provided they pass the **Air Traffic Skills Assessment (ATSA)** and meet additional FAA requirements.

Unlike standard AT-CTI programs, the enhanced version mirrors the training technology and curriculum of the FAA Academy in **Oklahoma City**, giving students a real-world simulation of what awaits them in the control tower.

> _“Enhanced AT-CTI programs like the one at Middle Georgia State University are key to building a next-generation workforce,”_ said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.
