# 🔥 Mercedes-AMG One Hypercar Recall: A $2.8M Fire Risk?

If you're lucky enough to own one of the most exclusive hypercars on Earth, this post is for you — and possibly your insurance agent.

## 🚨 AMG One Faces Global Recall Over Fire Risk

Mercedes-AMG has issued a global recall for the ultra-rare **AMG One**, a Formula 1-powered $2.8 million masterpiece. Out of the 275 units ever produced, **219** are now affected by a safety issue that could lead to a **potential fire hazard**.

> Unlike many recalls driven by engine defects or drivetrain issues, this one’s about **a missing pin** in the active rear spoiler’s hydraulic system — a tiny oversight that could have blazing consequences.

## 🛠️ What’s the Problem?

According to **Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA)**, the issue lies in the hydraulic lines that operate the active spoiler. A **small pin or locking component** designed to secure these hydraulic lines may be missing on a majority of units.

Without it, **hydraulic fluid could leak**, and in a mid-engine hypercar packed with heat-generating components, this **raises the risk of fire**.

### 📅 Units Built Between:
- **December 2022 – May 2025**
- Mostly delivered in Germany; others scattered across global markets

## 🔧 Real-World Fire Incidents

While no confirmed fires have yet been directly tied to this recall, **at least two AMG One units have already caught fire**:
- One during roadside driving in Germany
- Another while in transit in the UK back in 2023

No official investigation has linked these to the missing hydraulic pin — yet.

## 🧩 What's Being Done?

Mercedes-Benz will:
- Inspect the rear spoiler hydraulic system
- Ensure the locking pin is installed
- Complete the fix in **~90 minutes per car**

Owners will be contacted directly. And given the car’s value, we’d expect more than coffee and a coupon with that call.

## 💭 Final Thoughts: The Price of Perfection

The **AMG One** was never meant to be a regular car — it’s a **rolling trophy of engineering**, cramming a **1.6L hybrid F1 engine** into a road-legal machine with exotic materials, aggressive aero, and championship DNA.

But no machine is flawless. As we've seen time and again, even small overlooked parts — like a pin — can unravel millions of dollars in tech and trust.

This recall is a reminder that **luxury doesn't exempt you from risk**, and even **hand-built hypercars** must bow to basic mechanical integrity.

### ✅ Your Takeaway as an Enthusiast or Engineer:

- Always monitor recall bulletins, even for ultra-rare models
- Use quality-tested NSN and electronic components in custom builds
- Don’t skimp on quality where **heat, pressure, or hydraulic systems** are involved
